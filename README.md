# Pewlett Hackard Employee Retirement Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to help Pewlett Hackard prepare for a large exodus of retiring employees. First, we determined the number of retiring employees based on their title. Second, we as identified employees who are eligible to take part in a mentorship program prior to their future retirement. This would ensure the incoming employees would be properly trained, thereby limiting the disruption to Pewlett Hackard's operations.

## Results
- The positions of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff will have the largest void post retirement (25916 and 24926 respectively). This will need to be factored into the mentorship program, as these senior positions will need to be filled by the properly trained people.

- The eligible mentors is quite a small pool in comparison to the number of post-retirement positions soon to be available. There are only 1549 total employees eligible for the mentorship program, with 569 Senior Staff and 529 Senior Engineers available (see note above).

- Engineering positions will take the biggest hit upon retirement. This will likely have a large impact on production capabilities and outputs (35,201 total Engineers will be leaving).

## Summary
- The Production and Development departments have the largest number of retiring employees (8174 and 9281 respectively). These departments will require substantial support from the mentorship program.
