# Pewlett Hackard Employee Retirement Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to help Pewlett Hackard prepare for a large exodus of retiring employees. First, we determined the number of retiring employees based on their title. Second, we as identified employees who are eligible to take part in a mentorship program prior to their future retirement. This would ensure the incoming employees would be properly trained, thereby limiting the disruption to Pewlett Hackard's operations.

## Results
- The positions of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff will have the largest void post retirement (25916 and 24926 respectively). This will need to be factored into the mentorship program, as these senior positions will need to be filled by the properly qualified people.
