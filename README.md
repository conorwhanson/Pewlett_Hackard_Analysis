# Pewlett Hackard Employee Retirement Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to help Pewlett Hackard prepare for a large exodus of retiring employees. First, we determined the number of retiring employees based on their title. Second, we as identified employees who are eligible to take part in a mentorship program prior to their future retirement. This would ensure the incoming employees would be properly trained, thereby limiting the disruption to Pewlett Hackard's operations.

## Results
- The positions of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff will have the largest void post retirement event. This will need to be factored into the mentorship program, as these senior positions will need to be filled by the properly trained people (presumably people in the positions directly under the senior positions).

- The number of Managers retiring is negligible, with only 2 retiring. Management positions will not require much focus post-retirement event (see table above).

- The combined amount of Senior Engineers and Engineers retiring is quite large in comparison to all other positions.

- Overall the number of employees retiring is quite large. This will, regardless of efforts by Pewlett Hackard to counter it, be disruptive and require patience to see through.

## Summary
The total number of positions needing to be filled will be 41,380. 

The eligible mentors is quite a small pool in comparison to the number of post-retirement event positions soon to be available. There are only 1,549 total employees eligible for the mentorship program, with 569 Senior Staff and 529 Senior Engineers available.

The Production and Development departments have the largest number of retiring employees (8,174 and 9,281 respectively). This will almost certainly have a massive impact on the production capabilities of the company. In order to avoid production and development disruptions (and thereby delays) Pewlett Hackard will need to commit significant resources to these departments when the retirement event occurs.
