# Pewlett Hackard Employee Retirement Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to help Pewlett Hackard prepare for a large exodus of retiring employees. First, we determined the number of retiring employees based on their title. Second, we as identified employees who are eligible to take part in a mentorship program prior to their future retirement. This would ensure the incoming employees would be properly trained, thereby limiting the disruption to Pewlett Hackard's operations.
